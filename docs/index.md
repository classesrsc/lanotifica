# LaNotifica

Forward your Android notifications to your Linux desktop.

## Overview

LaNotifica is a simple tool that sends your phone notifications directly to your Linux desktop. Everything stays on your local network - no cloud, no accounts, no tracking.

## How It Works

1. Install the server on your Linux machine
2. Open the app on your Android phone
3. Scan the QR code shown by the server
4. Done - notifications appear on your desktop

The server and app find each other automatically using mDNS. All communication is encrypted with TLS.
